# Performance work

## Correctness gates

Benchmark timings require visible DOM changes. The DOM suite checks fresh 1k
and 10k selection transitions before timing. Alias routing and lightweight
component-row routing have regression coverage. Generated benchmark files must
come from the compiler.

Optimizations require compiler proof. Recognizing `map`, `push`, `splice`,
`reverse`, or another method name alone does not prove its behavior: methods can
be overridden, and getters or callbacks can read other state. Cases without
proof keep the conservative update path described in the compiler README.

## Implemented in this iteration

- List-row text uses normalized string slots to avoid unchanged DOM text reads.
  Expression evaluation and string conversion still replay.
- String class values skip array allocation during normalization.
- Each resolved reader set is enqueued before scheduling its commit. This
  avoids a separate commit per reader with a synchronous scheduler and lets
  parent reconciliation cancel pending duplicate row renders.

Measurements and limits are recorded in `bench/dom/README.md`.

## Investigated

- Canonical string key interning: estimates for Todo and Fieldnotes saved only
  37 B and 74 B gzip before accounting for an ID protocol. See
  `bench/package-size/README.md`. Numeric IDs and array lookup remain a candidate
  if a complete implementation produces a measured benefit and preserves path
  matching and independently installed access-table fragments.
- DOM and framework benchmark results exercise different workloads, list sizes,
  scheduler modes, and vanilla baselines. They do not establish one general
  framework ranking. Synchronous per-reader commits contributed to DOM fanout;
  broad selection still visits all matching rows.

## Remaining candidates from the review and Marko output

- Prove when module-state selection can refresh only the previous and next keyed
  rows. Preserve getter and key-expression semantics before narrowing fanout.
- Specialize proven list mutations, retaining conservative reconciliation for
  unknown behavior.
- Emit dynamic initialization and update expressions once where creation order
  and hydration adoption allow it.
- Reduce retained browser runtime machinery and investigate components with
  entirely local writes as a smaller routing entry point.
- Extend template cloning from rows to suitable component shapes.
- Check whether static components can skip registration.
- Gate more expensive slots with precise dirty reasons and restrict opaque pull
  work to dependent slots.
- Compare direct reader references or numeric routing with existing access-table
  expansion caches; measure register/unregister and dispatch costs together.
- Explore client omission of static/server-derived components only after
  confirming hydration markers and ownership permit it.
- Compare Marko's per-binding updates, shared multi-input update groups, keyed
  loop parameters, conditional-region setup, and dynamic-tag handling with the
  compiler's current emission. The pasted Marko examples included malformed or
  incomplete cases, so they are design references rather than executable
  performance baselines.

These candidates are not completed work. Each needs a correctness test and a
measurement before it becomes a default optimization.
